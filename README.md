# Smart-parking-using-python
We build our smart parking project by help of arduino and python open-cv which will detect the realtime parking slot conditions and as recent conditions user can easily parking their car by seeing the recent conditions of the parking slot. And as well as arduino help the user to get in and get out door using IR sensors and servo motors.
